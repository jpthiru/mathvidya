# ========================================
# NOTES FOR PYTHON 3.14 COMPATIBILITY
# ========================================
#
# ✅ FULLY VERIFIED (19 packages):
#   - FastAPI, uvicorn, python-multipart
#   - SQLAlchemy, asyncpg, alembic
#   - pydantic, pydantic-settings
#   - numpy, pandas, scikit-learn
#   - pillow
#   - pytest, pytest-asyncio, black, flake8, mypy
#   - httpx, python-dotenv
#
# ⚠️  LIKELY COMPATIBLE BUT NOT EXPLICITLY CONFIRMED (8 packages):
#   - python-jose, passlib (common auth packages, likely work)
#   - flower (Celery monitoring, should work with Celery 5.4.0)
#   - slowapi (rate limiting, simple package)
#   - boto3, botocore (AWS SDK supports 3.9+, likely works with 3.14)
#   - pytest-cov (works with pytest 8.3.4, likely compatible)
#   - psycopg2-binary (sync driver, widely compatible)
#
# ❌ NOT YET SUPPORTED (1 package):
#   - opencv-python: No official Python 3.14 wheels yet
#     Workaround: Build from source or wait for official release
#     Alternative: Use opencv-python-headless if you don't need GUI features
#
# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Install Python 3.14 (already done)
# 2. Create virtual environment:
#    python3.14 -m venv venv
# 3. Activate virtual environment:
#    venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
# 4. Upgrade pip:
#    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
# 5. Install dependencies:
#    pip install -r requirements_3_14.txt
#
# IF OPENCV-PYTHON FAILS:
# Option 1: Skip opencv-python for now (not needed for initial setup)
#   pip install -r requirements_3_14.txt --no-deps
#   pip install <each package individually except opencv-python>
# Option 2: Use opencv-python-headless instead
#   Comment out opencv-python line above
#   Add: opencv-python-headless==4.11.0.88
# Option 3: Build from source (advanced)
#   See: https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html
